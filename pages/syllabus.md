# PHY 555: Solid State Physics I

**Instructor:** Marivi Fernandez-Serra, Physics B139, maria.fernandez-serra@stonybrook.edu

**Lecture Time:** Mondays and Wednesdays 9:30-10:50am

**Web:** https://marivifs-teaching.github.io/PHY555-2024

**Office Hours:**
(Tentatively:) Mondays and Wednesdays 11:00 am - 12:00 pm


## Texts:
We will use a combination of books. In the past I have used the book by **Cohen and Louie (Fundamentals of Condensed Matter Physics, Cambridge University Press)**. I will use it also this semester for some sections. You can also choose to buy other. My preferred book has always been Ashcoft, tied to Ziman's. However the new book by Cohen and Luie is way more modern. This semester I will also use **Solid State Physics, by Giuseppe Grosso and Giuseppe Pastori
Parravicini**, any edition is fine (Elsevier, isbn: 9780080481029). The main reason this text was chosen, is that it provides more modern topics and treatment of solid-state
physics.


## Course Objectives:
* Understand the basic properties of crystalline solids and other condensed-matter systems
* Learn methods for describing the electronic and lattice structure of solids
* Understand the theory behind experimental probes of solid-state systems

## Lecture organization and topics:
Course material will be presented through lectures on the blackboard, and occasionally with slides. Notes
will be posted on the class website as well as further readings. Topics will include:


topic | G & P Ch. | C & L Ch.
------|-----------|---------
Crystal lattices | II | 2.5
Semiclassical treatment of electrons | III | 3.1  
Band theory of crystals | V | 3.2-3.7
Electronic structure properties and methods | II,VI | 6,7
Electronic excitations (excitons, plasmons) | VII | 8,9
Dielectric screening | VII | 8
Electron-lattice coupling, phonons | VIII, IX | 4,10
X-ray, neutron scattering | X | Na
Optical and transport properties | XI-XIV | 9,11,12
Magnetic properties | XV-XVII | 15
Superconductivity | XVIII | 14


## Homework:
Homework will be assigned every 1-2 weeks via the course webpage. Assignments will include conceptual,
analytical, and computational exercises (only very light coding will be required via, e.g., mathematica,
matlab, python, or another language of your choice). **Assignments will be submitted via Brightspace.**

**Homework will be worth 50 % of the final grade.**

## Exams:
There will be one midterm exam  and a final exam (during the assigned final exam period).
	
	* MT Exam Date November 4 (Monday) in Class time

The final will be cumulative. The midterm will be worth 20 % of the final grade, and the final
exam will be worth 30 % of the final grade.

### Americans with Disabilities Act:
If you have a physical, psychological, medical or learning disability that may impact your course work, please
contact Disability Support Services, ECC (Educational Communications Center) Building, Room 128, (631)
632-6748. They will determine with you what accommodations, if any, are necessary and appropriate. All
information and documentation is confidential.
Academic Integrity:
Each student must pursue his or her academic goals honestly and be personally accountable for all submitted
work. Representing another person’s work as your own is always wrong. Faculty are required to report
any suspected instances of academic dishonesty to the Academic Judiciary. Faculty in the Health Sciences
Center (School of Health Technology & Management, Nursing, Social Welfare, Dental Medicine) and School
of Medicine are required to follow their school-specific procedures. For more comprehensive information
on academic integrity, including categories of academic dishonesty, please refer to the academic judiciary
website at http://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/academic_integrity/


### Critical Incident Management:
Stony Brook University expects students to respect the rights, privileges, and property of other people.
Faculty are required to report to the Office of Judicial Affairs any disruptive behavior that interrupts
their ability to teach, compromises the safety of the learning environment, or inhibits students’ ability to
learn. Faculty in the HSC Schools and the School of Medicine are required to follow their school-specific
procedures.


### Electronic Communication:
Email to your University email account is an important way of communicating with you for this course.
For most students the email address is ‘firstname.lastname@stonybrook.edu’. It is your responsibility to
read your email received at this account. For instructions about how to verify your University email address
see this:

You can set up email forwarding using instructions here:

If you choose to forward your University email to another account, we are not responsible for any undeliverable messages.

### Religious Observances:
See the policy statement regarding religious holidays at
http://www.stonybrook.edu/registrar/forms/RelHolPol%20081612%20cr.pdf
Students are expected to notify the course professors by email of their intention to take time out for religious
observance. This should be done as soon as possible but definitely before the end of the ‘add/drop’ period.
At that time they can discuss with the instructor(s) how they will be able to make up the work covered.
